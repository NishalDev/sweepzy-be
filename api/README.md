# API Module

This module contains all the API endpoints and business logic for the application.
It follows a modular structure where each feature has its own directory with routes, models, schemas, controllers and services.
The API handles user management, litter detection/reporting, cleanup events, badges photo verification and more.
All endpoints are automatically loaded and registered with the FastAPI application through dynamic route discovery.
This module serves as the core backend functionality for the environmental monitoring and cleanup coordination system.
