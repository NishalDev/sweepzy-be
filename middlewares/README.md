# Middleware Module

This module contains FastAPI middleware components for request/response processing.
It includes authentication middleware for JWT token validation and user authorization.
Role-based access control middleware manages permissions and restricts access to protected endpoints.
Maintenance mode middleware can temporarily disable the application during updates or maintenance.
These middlewares provide cross-cutting concerns like security, logging, and request validation.
