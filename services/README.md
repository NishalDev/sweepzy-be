# Services Module

This module contains business logic services and external service integrations.
It provides base service classes and common service patterns used throughout the application.
Services encapsulate complex business logic, data processing, and external API interactions.
The base service provides common CRUD operations and database interaction patterns.
This module promotes separation of concerns by isolating business logic from API controllers.
