# Machine Learning Model Weights

This module contains trained machine learning model files and weights for litter detection.
It stores ONNX and PyTorch model files used for computer vision and object detection tasks.
The models are trained to identify and classify different types of litter in environmental images.
Model weights are loaded by the application for real-time litter detection and analysis.
This module enables the AI-powered environmental monitoring capabilities of the Sweepzy platform.
